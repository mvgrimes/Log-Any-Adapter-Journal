Changes for Log::Any::Adapter::Journal

1.0 - Fri Dec 11 10:48:27 EST 2020
    Fixes unexpected behavior of trace messages
    Systemd's journald doesn't support the trace level (8). Prior to version
    1.0, Log::Any::Adapter::Journal treated all trace messages as if they
    were debug messages. This meant that traces messages were printed when
    min_level=='debug'. With the 1.0 release, trace message are only printed
    when min_level=='trace'. They continue to be sent to journald as debug
    (7) level messages.
    [Upgrade recommended if using trace messages.]
